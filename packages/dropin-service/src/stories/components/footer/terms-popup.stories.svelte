Texting STOP to one shortcode or opting out of one text message Program will not effectuate a stop request for all shortcodes or text message Programs to which you are subscribed.&nbsp; You acknowledge and agree that texting STOP to any text message you receive from us will serve as an opt out of that specified Program only.

This dispute resolution procedure does not apply to the substance of any offer or promotion or to product purchases. This includes any claims asserted under the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and state telemarketing laws.&nbsp; We agree that regardless of whether the Dispute arises before or after the effective date of these Terms &amp; Conditions, then you and we agree to make a good faith effort to resolve the Dispute informally prior to initiating a formal arbitration proceeding. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you or we intend to initiate an arbitration proceeding, you or we must first send a written notice to the other providing a detailed description of the Dispute; your name and contact information (address, telephone number, and email address) or our contract information; sufficient information to enable you or us to identify any transaction at issue; and a detailed description of (1) the nature and basis of any claims, and (2) the nature and basis of the relief sought, with a detailed calculation for it.&nbsp;Your notice to us must be personally signed by you (and your attorney if you are represented).&nbsp; Our notice to you will be personally signed by our representative (and our attorney if we are represented).&nbsp; If requested by us in connection with a notice initiated by you, you must personally appear at and participate in an individualized telephone settlement conference (if you are represented by an attorney, your attorney may also participate) to discuss the Dispute in a good faith effort to resolve it.&nbsp; If requested by you in connection with a notice initiated by us, our representative must personally appear at and participate in an individualized telephone settlement conference (if we are represented by an attorney, our attorney may also participate).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your notice to us must be sent via email to: legal@adoreme.com.&nbsp; Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you have provided to us.&nbsp; For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of a fully completed notice from the other party, we and you will engage in a good faith dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute. &nbsp;If the Dispute is not resolved within sixty (60) days after receipt of the fully completed notice (which period can be extended by agreement of the parties), you or we may commence arbitration consistent with the process set forth below. Compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration.&nbsp; The party initiating arbitration must include as part of the demand for arbitration a personally signed certification of compliance with the informal dispute resolution process (if you initiate arbitration, then the certification must be signed by you and by your attorney, if you are represented; if we initiate arbitration, then the certification must be signed by our representative and our attorney, if we are represented.).&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sole exceptions to the requirement to arbitrate are that: (1) either party may elect to have individual claims heard in small claims court if those claims otherwise qualify for small claims court and as long as the matter remains in such court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction; and (2) each party may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.&nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Any applicable statute of limitations shall be tolled while the parties engage in this informal dispute resolution process.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&nbsp;If the sufficiency of a notice or compliance with this informal dispute resolution process is at issue, it may be decided by a court at either party&rsquo;s election, and any formal dispute resolution proceeding shall be stayed pending resolution of the issue.&nbsp; A court shall have the authority to enforce this condition precedent to arbitration, which includes the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of a demand for arbitration.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;H13ls4N-Vq2&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Arbitration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;B1peo4VWNc2&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth, then ANY AND ALL DISPUTES ARISING BETWEEN YOU AND US (WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE (INCLUDING THE FEDERAL TELEPHONE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND STATE TELEMARKETING LAWS), REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT&mdash;INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, ANY OTHER INTENTIONAL TORT OR NEGLIGENCE&mdash;COMMON LAW, CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION, RESPONDEAT SUPERIOR, AGENCY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY), WHETHER ARISING BEFORE OR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THESE TERMS, MUST BE RESOLVED BY FINAL AND BINDING ARBITRATION.&nbsp; Dispute shall be interpreted broadly.&nbsp; For U.S. residents, the Federal Arbitration Act (&ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;FAA&lt;/strong&gt;&rdquo;), not state law, shall govern the arbitrability of all Disputes, including the &ldquo;No Class Action Matters&rdquo; set forth below. BY AGREEING TO ARBITRATE, EACH PARTY IS GIVING UP ITS RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE ANY DISPUTE HEARD BY A JUDGE OR JURY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS.&lt;br /&gt;Any Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&rdquo;) of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;AAA&lt;/strong&gt;&rdquo;) except as modified herein, and the arbitration will be administered by the AAA consistent with this agreement.&nbsp; If the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this agreement, then the parties agree that the arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (&ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;NAM&lt;/strong&gt;&rdquo;) under its then-current rules as modified by this agreement.&nbsp; If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to administer the arbitration consistent with this agreement, the parties will work together in good faith to agree on an arbitration administrator that will do so consistent with this agreement.&nbsp; If the parties cannot agree on an arbitration administrator, then they will petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint one that will administer the arbitration consistent with this agreement.&nbsp; The AAA rules are available at&nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.adr.org/Rules&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;https://www.adr.org/Rules[1]&nbsp;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&nbsp;The NAM rules are available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If you have any questions about how to access information about the AAA or NAM, please contact them (their up-to-date contact information is available on their websites) or us at&nbsp;legal@adoreme.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To begin an arbitration proceeding, after satisfying the informal process identified above, you or we must (1) send a personally signed demand for arbitration that describes (a) the nature and basis of the claims, and (b) the nature and basis of the relief sought, including a detailed calculation for it; (2) send the signed certification of completion of the process identified above; and (3) contact the AAA, NAM, or the applicable court-appointed arbitration administrator and follow the appropriate procedures to commence the arbitration. You and we, if you or we are represented by an attorney in connection with your or our arbitration demand, agree that any arbitration demand must also be signed by your or our attorney. &nbsp;By signing the arbitration demand, the attorney certifies to the best of their information, knowledge, and belief, formed after a reasonable inquiry that: (1) the arbitration demand is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (2) the claims or other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (3) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.&nbsp; The arbitrator shall be authorized to impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11. Your demand for arbitration must be sent to us via email at &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:legal@adoreme.com&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;legal@adoreme.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  Our demand for arbitration to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you have provided to us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except as provided below, you may choose to have the arbitration conducted by phone, video, in-person or through written submissions, except any Dispute over $50,000 shall have an in-person or video hearing. We reserve the right to request a hearing in any matter from the arbitrator.&nbsp; If you initiate arbitration, then you agree to personally appear at any in-person, video, or telephonic hearing (along with your attorney if you are represented).&nbsp; If we initiate arbitration, then we agree to have a representative appear at any in-person, video, or telephonic hearing (along with our attorney if we are represented).&nbsp; If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted at a location that is reasonably convenient to you or at another mutually agreed location. The arbitrator shall be located in reasonable proximity to you or the mutually agreed location if a hearing is required or requested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arbitration fees shall be governed by the applicable arbitration administrator rules, unless they are authorized by law or the arbitrator determines that a claim or proceeding was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or in bad faith (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require us to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this arbitration provision to be enforceable, then we will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration.&nbsp; In addition, the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 (cost-shifting) shall apply and be enforced by the arbitrator after entry of an award. &nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator who will apply and be bound by these Terms &amp; Conditions as a court would, and will determine any Dispute according to applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written award only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent to provide relief warranted by that party&rsquo;s individual claim.&nbsp; Except as expressly provided herein, all issues, including scope, are for the arbitrator to decide. The arbitration award shall be binding only among the parties to the arbitration and shall have no preclusive effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a&nbsp;different party.&nbsp;This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms &amp; Conditions.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;rJAxjNEW452&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;No Class Action Matters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;BJyZiN4Z45h&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OR AS AN ASSOCIATION.&nbsp; Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be joined or consolidated with any other arbitrations or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party.&nbsp; There shall be no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on any basis involving Disputes brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public, or other persons or entities similarly situated.&nbsp; This section (the class action waiver) is an essential part of this agreement.&nbsp; If, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), and all appeals from that decision have been exhausted (or the decision is otherwise final), then the parties agree that that particular claim or request for relief may proceed in court but shall be stayed pending arbitration of the remaining claims.&nbsp; Specifically, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this provision, the arbitrator may not issue a &ldquo;public injunction&rdquo; and any such &ldquo;public injunction,&rdquo; if permitted, may be awarded only by a federal or state court. In doing so, the federal or state court is bound under principles of claim or issue preclusion by the decision of the arbitrator.&nbsp;Notwithstanding any other provision of this arbitration agreement, any and all issues relating to the scope, interpretation and enforceability of the class action waiver provisions contained herein (described in this &ldquo;No Class Action Matters&rdquo; section), are to be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction, and not by the arbitrator.&nbsp; The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these class action waiver provisions.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;Sye-jEEW49h&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;Exclusions from Arbitration Requirement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;rk-ZjVNbNq2&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may elect to have heard a qualifying claim or Dispute in small claims court of competent jurisdiction as long as the matter remains in such court and is not removed In addition to small claims court proceeding, the arbitration provisions will not apply to any legal action taken by Adore Me to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) in connection with its intellectual property rights.&nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;SJzZj4NZ49n&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Governing Law and Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;HJ7-iV4WN93&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;Except as expressly provided above, these Terms &amp; Conditions will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute will be resolved in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions.&nbsp;To the fullest extent permitted by law, to the extent any matter proceeds in court, except for small claims court and the Excluded Disputes set forth above, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in New York County in the State of New York.&lt;br /&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;r14-jN4ZVc2&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Additional Procedures for Mass Arbitration&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div data-section-type=&quot;1&quot; class=&quot;ps-section&quot; data-id=&quot;H1SWsV4W492&quot; data-time=&quot;1689682994918&quot;&gt;If your claim is part of twenty-five (25) or more similar claims asserted against us by the same or coordinated counsel or are otherwise coordinated, you understand and agree that these additional procedures apply and the resolution of your Dispute might be delayed. &nbsp;You agree to the following staged process and application of the AAA Multiple Consumer Case Filing Fee Schedule (or NAM fee schedule). &nbsp;Your counsel and our counsel shall each select twenty-five (25) cases (per side) to proceed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of an initial staged bellwether process. &nbsp;The remaining cases shall not be filed or deemed filed in arbitration nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those cases until they are selected to proceed to individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged bellwether process.
