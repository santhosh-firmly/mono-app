Prompt: “UI Design Philosophy”
Design everything with a minimalist, typography-first aesthetic inspired by Claude, ChatGPT, and The New York Times.
Core rules:
Prioritize content and readability — no clutter, no decoration.
Centered layout, max width 680px, generous whitespace.
Typography: serif for headings, sans-serif for body; small refined sizes (15px base, 13px/12px secondary).
Colors: neutral palette
bg #FAFAFA, text #1A1A1A, muted #737373, border #E5E5E5, accent blue #2563EB.
Interactions: subtle only — light hover states, smooth 200–300ms transitions, no shadows or heavy effects.
Components: clean borders, no gradients, no icons unless functional.
Tailwind v4 CSS-first setup, using @theme custom properties.
Code style: simple, composable Svelte components using cn() to merge classes.
Avoid visual noise (bold colors, big typography, complex layouts).
Embrace whitespace, subtlety, and hierarchy through font weight/size — not color.
Goal: Elegant, content-first UI that feels calm, precise, and timeless.
